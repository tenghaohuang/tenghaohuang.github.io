I am excited to return as a part-time research intern at Microsoft in Fall 2025. My spring intern paper [Teaching Language Models to Gather Information Proactively](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21389) is accepted by EMNLP-Findings 2025. I will keep working on post-training LLMs to align with human preferences:)

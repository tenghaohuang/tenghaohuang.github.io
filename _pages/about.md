Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Tenghao Huang, a fourth-year PhD candidate at USC Viterbi School of Engineering. I am adviced by Prof. [Jonathan May](https://jonmay.github.io/webpage/) , Prof. <a href="https://muhaochen.github.io/">Muhao Chen</a>. I have interned at Amazon Alexa AI, IBM Research, Microsoft's Office of Applied Research and Salesforce AI Research.

Before I join USC, I did my bachelor at UNC-CH. I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snigdhac/">Snigdha Chaturvedi</a> and Prof. <a href="https://colinraffel.com/">Colin Raffel</a>.

I am genuinely interested in how LLM agents can help human solve real-world problems. Specifically, I am curious about how LLM agents can enhance human productivity in task-oriented scenarios, such as writing, coding, and planning. Check out our NAACL 2025 tutorial on [Creative Planning with LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-tutorial.1/)!

I am also interested in studying AI creativity, especially how AI can assist human in composing longer and more interesting narratives. Our paper **Are Large Language Models Capable of Generating Human-Level Narratives?** received the **<span style="color:red;">Outstanding Paper Award 🏆</span>** at EMNLP 2024!

I am currently on the faculty job market this year and actively seeking academic positions.
